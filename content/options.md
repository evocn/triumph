*Long* implies that a weapon can strike at a distance, but makes it unwieldy if someone's closed the gap.

# Abilities
Here's some examples of Abilities for when you level up. You can choose something here, or you can invent your own!

- **Myrmidon** | You may use Clarity instead of Strength to wield swords when using **Quarrel**. Your sword attacks ignore Armor.
- **Precision** | You gain +2 to your **Volley** rolls.
- **Eagle Eye** | You cannot be surprised. You can ask "How many hit points do they have" as a part of **Discern Realities**.
- **Protector** | You get +2 Armor when you use the **Defend** Move.
- **Talented** | You choose two extra talents, and you get +1 to all checks using one chosen talent, which we deem your "super duper talent".
- **Martial Arts** | Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 damage. You gain a talent in grappling. Any character who attempts to get past you is stopped in their tracks.

And here's some examples of custom Moves:

### Bend Bars, Lift Gates
When you use pure strength to destroy an inanimate obstacle, roll + Strength. 
- On a 10+, choose 3. 
- On a 7-9 choose 2.
- It doesn’t take a very long time
- Nothing of value is damaged
- It doesn’t make an inordinate amount of noise
- You can fix the thing again without a lot of effort

### Called Shot
When you attack a defenseless or surprised enemy at range, you can choose to deal your damage or name your target and roll + Agility.

*Head*
- 10+: As 7–9, plus your damage 
- 7-9: They do nothing but stand and drool for a few moments

*Arms*
- 10+: As 7-9, plus your damage 
- 7-9: They drop anything they’re holding

*Legs*
