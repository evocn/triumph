## Dervish
Your Faith sustains you on your journey.

But if your faith falters, then you will have nothing to guide you but your self.

## Druid
You live in the wilderness. Any time you enter a civilized location, you lose the potency of your abilities here.
The only way to ensure you can use your powers is by retaining some piece of a familiar natural home, like a leaf from your favorite tree, or a baby bunny.
- Beast Knowledge | Understand Animals of all kinds. Calm beasts easily. Track animals and people without fail.
- Attunement | Judge the weather, direction, and subtle signals from the environment.
- Sending | Communicate with other people perfectly non-verbally with hand-signals, clicks, and facial gestures.
- Morph | Once per session, take the form of a little critter.

## Paladin
Every sunrise, you make a solemn vow.
If it is worthy, you may use your powers.
If you falter in your vow, you lose these abilities.
- Lay on Hands | Heal a wound once per sunrise. You can even do this as an action in combat.
- Duel | Compel a creature into a duel. None may intervene.
- Smite | Take a Minor Wound to deal +6 damage on an attack. This attack cannot be Sundered and ignores Armor.
- Discernment | Detect lies without fail.

## Wizard
You have studied magic, learning a way to interpret old tricks written down in Hermetic circles.
You have no power on your own, but given the right scroll, materials, and an arcane focus, you can perform incredible feats!
Spell Book | You start with three Scrolls in your book. When you use a Scroll, it disintegrates. Many Scrolls exist in the world, in dusty old tomes, but in your initial collection, choose three from the list below:
	- Magic Missile | Roll an attack against an opponent you can see, using your Knowledge, dealing 1d4 damage on a hit, which ignores all Armor.
	- Shield | Nullify an attack coming your way.
	- Warp | Teleport someone or something you can see up to 30 feet away from its initial position.
	- Slow / Quicken | Make a zone progress at half speed or double speed for one minute.
	- Feather / Stone | Make an object or creature light as a feather, or heavy as a boulder for one minute.
	- Freeze | Fix a creature or object in space for one minute.
	- Levitate | You can walk horizontally on air for one minute.
	- Jump / Dash | A creature you touch gains the ability to leap up to 10 feet and run twice as fast for one minute.
- Scry | You have advantage on Lore checks. Once per session, you can try to locate an item or person you know about. If you possess something familiar to that thing, your scrying will always succeed.
- Identify | Determine the properties of some unknown object.

Familiar | You get a little magic pet who can help you do things.

Vision | Once per session, you can glean a vision of the future or the past of a location, creature, or object from touching it. You cannot control the vision's course or direction. You can also enter a sleeping creature's dream.

Taboo | Once per game, break the laws of reality (e.g. revive a fallen ally, move a mountain, travel through time or space). Some things are still impossible. All things come at a cost.
