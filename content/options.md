Here's some examples of Abilities. You can choose something here, or you can invent your own!

- **Myrmidon** | You may use Clarity instead of Strength to wield swords when using **Quarrel**. Your sword attacks ignore Armor.
- **Precision** | You gain +2 to your **Volley** rolls.
- **Eagle Eye** | You cannot be surprised. You can ask "How many hit points do they have" as a part of **Discern Realities**.
- **Protector** | You get +2 Armor when you use the **Defend** Move.
- **Talented** | You choose two extra talents, and you get +1 to all checks using one chosen talent, which we deem your "super duper talent".
- **Martial Arts** | Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 damage. You gain a talent in grappling. Any character who attempts to get past you is stopped in their tracks.
