- Attunement | Judge the weather, direction, and subtle signals from the environment.

## Paladin
Every sunrise, you make a solemn vow.
If it is worthy, you may use your powers.
If you falter in your vow, you lose these abilities.
- Lay on Hands | Heal a wound once per sunrise. You can even do this as an action in combat.
- Duel | Compel a creature into a duel. None may intervene.
- Smite | Take a Minor Wound to deal +6 damage on an attack. This attack cannot be Sundered and ignores Armor.
- Discernment | Detect lies without fail.

You have studied magic, learning a way to interpret old tricks written down in Hermetic circles.
You have no power on your own, but given the right scroll, materials, and an arcane focus, you can perform incredible feats!
Spell Book | You start with three Scrolls in your book. When you use a Scroll, it disintegrates. Many Scrolls exist in the world, in dusty old tomes, but in your initial collection, choose three from the list below:
	- Magic Missile | Roll an attack against an opponent you can see, using your Knowledge, dealing 1d4 damage on a hit, which ignores all Armor.
	- Shield | Nullify an attack coming your way.
	- Warp | Teleport someone or something you can see up to 30 feet away from its initial position.
	- Slow / Quicken | Make a zone progress at half speed or double speed for one minute.
	- Feather / Stone | Make an object or creature light as a feather, or heavy as a boulder for one minute.
	- Freeze | Fix a creature or object in space for one minute.
	- Levitate | You can walk horizontally on air for one minute.
	- Jump / Dash | A creature you touch gains the ability to leap up to 10 feet and run twice as fast for one minute.
- Scry | You have advantage on Lore checks. Once per session, you can try to locate an item or person you know about. If you possess something familiar to that thing, your scrying will always succeed.
- Identify | Determine the properties of some unknown object.

Familiar | You get a little magic pet who can help you do things.

Vision | Once per session, you can glean a vision of the future or the past of a location, creature, or object from touching it. You cannot control the vision's course or direction. You can also enter a sleeping creature's dream.

Taboo | Once per game, break the laws of reality (e.g. revive a fallen ally, move a mountain, travel through time or space). Some things are still impossible. All things come at a cost.
