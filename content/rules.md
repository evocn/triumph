# The Basics

The game runs pretty differently than Dungeons and Dragons.
Here's some nuggets which summarizes most of the big differences:
- No turns are taken, we play conversationally.
- The GM doesn't roll dice very often.
- Some things give you Armor, which just subtracts from any damage dealt (unless the damage ignores Armor).
- Fighting groups of enemies, they don't all roll damage. Instead, the strongest enemy rolls damage, and for each additional enemy, they just add +1 damage to the final total.

## Attributes
The Attributes are ***Strength***, ***Agility***, ***Vigor***, ***Knowledge***, ***Clarity***, and ***Wit***.

(I just like the names a little better).

## Hit Points
When you have zero Hit Points, you die.

## Armor
Armor reduces damage taken.

## The Core Mechanic
This game features a core mechanic from the game *Apocalypse World*.

The game revolves around ***Moves***. All moves involve rolling 2D6, and adding relevant modifiers.

If the total is 10+, they succeed at the task completely!
If the total is 7-9, they succeed at the task, but with some complication.
If the total is 6 or lower, they fail at the task. The DM determines any additional effects. Mark XP.

I've listed the basic moves in a section below.

## Talents
Talents are specific tasks which your character is very proficient at.
It can be anything, so long as it's specific. "Seduction" or "Piloting a vessel at sea", not "Combat".
When they take a move governed by a Talent, they reroll 1s and 2s once.

# Basic Moves
Below are listed the moves which all characters can use.

---
### Quarrel
When you attack an enemy in melee, roll + Strength. 
- On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy’s attack.
- On a 7–9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.

On maximum damage rolled by a melee weapon, you deal Critical damage, meaning you roll your damage die again!

---
### Volley
When you take aim and shoot at an enemy at range, or throw a weapon like a dagger, roll + Agility.
- On a 10+, you have a clear shot - deal your damage.
- On a 7–9, you deal your damage, but choose one:
  - You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger as described by the GM.
  - You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage.
  - Your shot bungles your weapon, causing you to have to fiddle with it in private before you can fire again.

---
### Defend
When you stand in defense of a person, item, or location under attack, roll + Vigor.
- On a 10+, hold 3.
- On a 7–9, hold 1.
As long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:
- Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself
- Halve the attack’s effect or damage
- Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 against the attacker
- Deal damage to the attacker equal to your level

---
### Parley
> When you have leverage on an NPC and manipulate them, roll + Wit. Leverage is something they need or want.
> - On a 10+, they do what you ask if you first promise what they ask of you.
> - On a 7–9, they will do what you ask, but need some concrete assurance of your promise, right now.

---
### Discern
When you closely study a situation or person, roll + Clarity.
- On a 10+, ask the GM a question about a situation, character, or story.
- On a 7–9, ask the question, but something consequential happens too.

---
### Recall
When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, roll + Knowledge.
- On a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation.
- On a 7–9, the GM will only tell you something interesting - it’s on you to make it useful. The GM might ask you “How do you know this?”

---
### Defy Danger
When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it…
- …by getting out of the way or acting fast, + Agility
- …by powering through, + Strength
- …by enduring, + Vigor
- …using charm and social grace, + Wit
- …with sharp senses and calm, + Clarity
- …with quick thinking, + Knowledge
- On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to bear.
- On a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.

---
### Recover
When you do nothing but rest in comfort and safety after a day of rest you recover all your HP.

---
### Level Up
When you have 10 XP and a bit of downtime, you can reflect on your experiences and hone your skills.
- Add +1 to your Level.
- Increase one of your Attributes by 1. Attributes can’t go higher than +3.
- Choose one of:
  - Gain a new Talent based on what you've been up to.
  - Create a new Ability for your character.

---
### Death
When you’re dying, roll.
- On a 10+, you’ve cheated Death—you’re in a bad spot but you’re still alive.
- On a 7–9, you survive the fate, but there is some permanent effect on you.
- On 6-, your fate is sealed. You will die soon.

# Character Generation
Distribute **[+2, +1, 0, -0, -1, -2]** in the Attributes.

Mark **Hit Points** as 15 + (Vigor * 5).

Choose your starting **Gear** from the [The list](/triumph/options/).
