# The Basics
## The Core Mechanic
This game features a core mechanic from the game *Apocalypse World*.

The game revolves around ***Moves***. All moves involve rolling 2D6, and adding relevant modifiers.

If the total is 10+, they succeed at the task completely!
If the total is 7-9, they succeed at the task, but with some complication.
If the total is 6 or lower, they fail at the task. The DM determines any additional effects. Mark XP.

I've listed the basic moves in a section below.

## Attributes
***Strength***, ***Dexterity***, ***Constitution***, ***Knowledge***, ***Clarity***, and ***Wit***.

## Hit Points
HP are an assessment of a character's energy.

## Talents
Talents are specific tasks which your character is very proficient at.
It can be anything, so long as it's specific. "Seduction" or "Piloting a vessel at sea", not "Combat", capische?
When they take a move governed by a Talent, they reroll 1s and 2s once.

## Details
The game runs pretty differently than Dungeons and Dragons.
Here's some nuggets which summarizes most of the big differences:
- No turns are taken, we play conversationally.
- The GM doesn't roll any move dice, only the players do.
- Fighting groups of enemies, they don't all roll damage. Instead, the strongest enemy rolls damage, and for each additional enemy, they just add +1 damage to the final total.
- On maximum damage rolled by a weapon, you deal Critical damage, meaning you roll your damage die again!
- Some things give you Armor, which just subtracts from any damage dealt (unless the damage ignores Armor).

# Basic Moves
Below are listed the moves which all characters can use.

---
Quarrel (Strength)
> When you attack an enemy in melee, roll +STR. 
> - On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy’s attack. 
> - On a 7–9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.

---
Volley (Dexterity)
> When you take aim and shoot at an enemy at range, roll +DEX.
> - On a 10+, you have a clear shot - deal your damage.
> - On a 7–9, you deal your damage, but the player chooses one:
>   - You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger as described by the GM.
>   - You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage.
>   - Your shot bungles your weapon, causing you to have to fiddle with it in private before you can fire again.

---
Defend (Constitution)
> When you stand in defense of a person, item, or location under
attack, roll +CON.
> - On a 10+, hold 3.
> - On a 7–9, hold 1.
> As long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:
> - Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself
> - Halve the attack’s effect or damage
> - Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 against the attacker
> - Deal damage to the attacker equal to your level

---
Parley (Wit)
> When you have leverage on an NPC and manipulate them, roll +WIT. Leverage is something they need or want.
> - On a 10+, they do what you ask if you first promise what they ask of you.
> - On a 7–9, they will do what you ask, but need some concrete assurance of your promise, right now.

---
Discern (Clarity)
> When you closely study a situation or person, roll +CLA.
> - On a 10+, ask the GM 3 questions from the list below. 
> - On a 7–9, ask 1.
> Either way, take +1 when acting on the answers.
> - What happened here recently?
> - What is about to happen?
> - What should I be on the lookout for?
> - What here is useful or valuable to me?
> - Who’s really in control here?
> - What here is not what it appears to be?

---
Recall (Knowledge)
> When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something,
roll +KNO.
> - On a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and
useful about the subject relevant to your situation.
> - On a 7–9, the GM will only tell you something interesting - it’s on you to make it useful.
> The GM might ask you “How do you know this?”

---
Defy Danger
> When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it…
> - …by getting out of the way or acting fast, +DEX
> - …by powering through, +STR
> - …by enduring, +CON
> - …using charm and social grace, +WIT
> - …with sharp senses and calm, +CLA
> - …with quick thinking, +KNO
> - On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to bear.
> - On a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.

---
Carouse
> When you return triumphant and throw a big party, each character rolls. 
> - On a 10+, choose 3.
> - On a 7–9, choose 1.
> - On a miss, you still choose one, but things get really out of hand (the GM will say how).
> - You befriend a useful NPC.
> - You hear rumors of an opportunity.
> - You gain useful information.
> - You are not entangled, ensorcelled, or tricked.

---
Recover
> When you do nothing but rest in comfort and safety after a day of rest you recover all your HP.

---
Level Up
> When you have 5 XP and a bit of downtime, you can reflect on your experiences and hone your skills.
> - Add +1 to your Level.
> - If your Level is now odd...
>   - Create a new Ability for your character.
> - If your Level is now even...
>   - Gain a new talent.
> - Choose one of your Attributes and increase it by 1. Attributes can’t go higher than +3.

---
Death
> When you’re dying, roll.
> - On a 10+, you’ve cheated Death—you’re in a bad spot but you’re still alive.
> - On a 7–9, Death himself will offer you a bargain. Take it and stabilize or refuse and die.
> - On 6-, your fate is sealed. You will die soon.
