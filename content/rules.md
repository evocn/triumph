title: Rules
---
***The Core Mechanic*** - This is a 2D6-based game.
> ***DCs:*** Easy: **7** | Moderate: **9** | Hard: **11**

I tend to resolve most things without dice when characters are proficient at something, have a significant advantage or good plan, or when they are not under any particular pressure.
Sometimes rolls can have partial success or consequences. I'll always tell you in advance what a roll entails.

---
***Attributes*** - There are 5 attributes which govern characters, which typically range from -3 to +3.
- ***Agility*** - Dodging, sneaking, leaping.
- ***Strength*** - Pushing, pulling, climbing, wrestling, melee weapons.
- ***Clarity*** - Perception, ranged weapons, detection of details.
- ***Knowledge*** - Lore, survival, mending of injuries, use of technology, conversational ability.
- ***Grit*** - Ability to withstand pain and stay alive when injured.

> New characters distribute **[+2, +1, 0, -1, -2]** in these five scores.

---
***Talent*** - A character's learned or innate capacity to perform some task. It can be anything, as long as it's specific, like *climbing* or *repairing things* or *seduction* or *long bow*.

A talented character often doesn't need to roll checks.
When they do, talents allow you to **reroll 1's** from your initial roll.

---
***Ability*** - Something unique that only your character can do. You pick one when you make your character. In epic-length games (2-3 sessions), a character might learn additional Abilities, too, but usually you just have one.

There's a bunch listed in [Options](options.md), but you can make up your own too.

---
# Combat
***Turns*** - Combat happens in rounds. There isn't initiative, we just go around the table in order, then the enemies go.
Each round, you can move and do an **Action**.

---
***To Hit*** - Roll **2D6**. Add **Strength** to melee weapons, Add **Clarity** to ranged weapons.
You need to beat the target's **Avoid**, which is [7 + **Agility**].

---
***Wounds*** - In this game, weapons cause Wounds.

Roll damage for your weapon, subtract the target's **Armor** and convert that number below.

> 0-3: **Just grazed you. No wounds.** | 4-7: **1 Wound**. | 8+: **2 Wounds**.

If a character takes more Wounds than they can bear, which is [2 + **Grit**], they pass out.
An unconscious character who takes another Wound dies.

Here's a list of some example wounds.
- **Broken Arm.** -2 Strength. -1 Hand.
- **Broken Leg**. -2 Agility. Half speed.
- **Brain Damage**. -2 to Knowledge, Clarity.
- **Deep Gash**. No immediate effects, but if left untreated for an hour, you will die.

That's just a few, though. I've got my own chart I roll on to determine wounds most of the time.

---
***Critical*** - On a weapon's maximum damage output, you score a critical! You roll damage again, which can also critical indefinitely.

---
***Rest*** - Characters who have time to rest in the game can attempt to mend or mitigate their Wounds.

If you have a week of rest or travel, you can mend up to one wound per week.

If you're under duress or trying to mend a wound in a short timeframe (like overnight), any character in the group can roll a DC 10 Knowledge check to mend wounds. They only roll once per wound per rest, and if they fail, the wound remains.

---
***Grappling*** - You can attempt to grapple with an opponent by making a Strength check against their avoid. If you succeed, you and your opponent are locked together in a grappling match.

On their turn, a grappler can choose from the following options:
- Attack the enemy with an unarmed strike or a knife.
- Move the enemy up to five feet.
- Escape from the grapple, by rolling against the enemy's Strength + 7.
- Tighten their hold. Impose a -2 penalty on the enemy's escape.
- Maneuver the enemy into an advantageous position. Impose a -2 penalty to the enemy's Avoid.
- Maneuver the enemy to protect your own body. 

Grapplers are free to drop or equip items while grappling.

---
Any action which isn't an attack is a **Maneuver**.

Here's a list of basic maneuvers anyone can use.
- **Dodge** | Give yourself +2 Agility and +2 Armor till next turn.
- **Defend** | Take all attacks targeting a nearby ally.
- **Disarm** | With an open hand, you can attempt to disarm an opponent. You roll a Strength check against your opponent's Avoid. If you succeed, you disarm your opponent of one weapon they carry.
- **Dash** | Move again.
- **Shove** | You make an unarmed attack against an enemy's Avoid to try to push them up to 5 feet.

**Abilities** can introduce maneuvers that only specific characters can use.

---
# Equipment
This game focuses a lot on keeping the stuff you carry and wear grounded in a dramatic way.

---
You can **Carry** equipment in your **Hands**.
For most two-handed people, that means you can carry two small things or one large thing.

---
You can **Attach** up to 2 Hands worth of things to your body with a scabbard or belt loops.
Each item you attach to yourself in this way gives you a -1 Agility penalty.

---
***Pack*** - You can use one if you want. It carries 4 Hands worth of gear.

While you're carrying it:
- Move at half speed.
- Have -2 Agility.
- Have -2 Strength when climbing or pulling your weight.

It takes a full action to take off or put on a pack, or to retrieve an item from it.

---
***Trinket*** - A small item you could keep in your pocket or tied around your neck.
Everyone can carry one trinket for free.

---
***Beasts of Burden*** - Animals and carts can carry items, too! It's hard to get a Donkey into a Dungeon, though... (that is, of course, what D&D stands for, though, so you should try anyways.)

---
***Sunder*** - Rolling snake eyes when you roll to hit with a weapon causes it to break in your hands!

A skilled fighter can willingly sunder their equipment to avoid taking a wound against an opponent's attack if it was determined to be a hit. Note they make the decision *before* damage is rolled and wounds are calculated!

---
# Fate
In stories and in life, fate smiles upon the brave and the bold. This game is no different.

A **Fate** point may be used to reroll any roll, anywhere on the table.

---
When you make your character, you get one Fate point automatically.

You can choose to give your character -1 to one of your positive attributes in exchange for fate points.
This might make sense for your character - if you're playing a teenager or some drunk, for instance.

---
***Death and Elimination*** - Characters who, through play, die, cannot continue, or leave the path of the story, are left behind, either to continue their story another time, or to fall, as so many do, into the dust of memory. This will likely be a common occurrence, so here's how we'll handle things.

If it's a short game (1 session), and a character leaves, that's it! (Though they can still influence the game, see **Legacy** below.)

If we're telling a longer story and a character dies, then we'll introduce a new character for the widowed player to play starting the following session.

---
***Legacy*** - When a player doesn't have an active character during a session, they can still use their **Fate** points to help an active character. In fact, when your character leaves the story, they gain one extra Fate point to use!

In addition to the above options for Fate, you can also allow an active character to act using your character's attributes and talents for a turn.

Imagine a priest's warrior friend is slain in front of them, and they pick up their sword, imbued with their friend's spirit, to avenge them! That's what a legacy is about.
