<h1 id="the-basics">The Basics</h1>
<p>The game runs pretty differently than Dungeons and Dragons.
Here&rsquo;s some nuggets which summarizes most of the big differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>No turns are taken, we play conversationally.</li>
<li>The GM doesn&rsquo;t roll dice very often.</li>
<li>Some things give you Armor, which just subtracts from any damage dealt (unless the damage ignores Armor).</li>
<li>Fighting groups of enemies, they don&rsquo;t all roll damage. Instead, the strongest enemy rolls damage, and for each additional enemy, they just add +1 damage to the final total.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>
<p>The Attributes are <em><strong>Strength</strong></em>, <em><strong>Agility</strong></em>, <em><strong>Vigor</strong></em>, <em><strong>Knowledge</strong></em>, <em><strong>Clarity</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Wit</strong></em>.</p>
<p>(I just like the names a little better).</p>
<h2 id="hit-points">Hit Points</h2>
<p>When you have zero Hit Points, you die.</p>
<h2 id="armor">Armor</h2>
<p>Armor reduces damage taken.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-mechanic">The Core Mechanic</h2>
<p>This game features a core mechanic from the game <em>Apocalypse World</em>.</p>
<p>The game revolves around <em><strong>Moves</strong></em>. All moves involve rolling 2D6, and adding relevant modifiers.</p>
<p>If the total is 10+, they succeed at the task completely!
If the total is 7-9, they succeed at the task, but with some complication.
If the total is 6 or lower, they fail at the task. The DM determines any additional effects. Mark XP.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve listed the basic moves in a section below.</p>
<h2 id="talents">Talents</h2>
<p>Talents are specific tasks which your character is very proficient at.
It can be anything, so long as it&rsquo;s specific. &ldquo;Seduction&rdquo; or &ldquo;Piloting a vessel at sea&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Combat&rdquo;.
When they take a move governed by a Talent, they reroll 1s and 2s once.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="basic-moves">Basic Moves</h1>
<p>Below are listed the moves which all characters can use.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="quarrel">Quarrel</h3>
<p>When you attack an enemy in melee, roll + Strength.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+, you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy’s attack.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.</li>
</ul>
<p>On maximum damage rolled by a melee weapon, you deal Critical damage, meaning you roll your damage die again!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="volley">Volley</h3>
<p>When you take aim and shoot at an enemy at range, or throw a weapon like a dagger, roll + Agility.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+, you have a clear shot - deal your damage.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, you deal your damage, but choose one:
<ul>
<li>You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger as described by the GM.</li>
<li>You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage.</li>
<li>Your shot bungles your weapon, causing you to have to fiddle with it in private before you can fire again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="defend">Defend</h3>
<p>When you stand in defense of a person, item, or location under attack, roll + Vigor.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+, hold 3.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, hold 1.
As long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:</li>
<li>Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself</li>
<li>Halve the attack’s effect or damage</li>
<li>Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 against the attacker</li>
<li>Deal damage to the attacker equal to your level</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="parley">Parley</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have leverage on an NPC and manipulate them, roll + Wit. Leverage is something they need or want.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+, they do what you ask if you first promise what they ask of you.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, they will do what you ask, but need some concrete assurance of your promise, right now.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3 id="discern">Discern</h3>
<p>When you closely study a situation or person, roll + Clarity.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+, ask the GM a question about a situation, character, or story.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, ask the question, but something consequential happens too.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="recall">Recall</h3>
<p>When you consult your accumulated knowledge about something, roll + Knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, the GM will only tell you something interesting - it’s on you to make it useful. The GM might ask you “How do you know this?”</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="defy-danger">Defy Danger</h3>
<p>When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it…</p>

<li>…by getting out of the way or acting fast, + Agility</li>
<li>…by powering through, + Strength</li>
<li>…by enduring, + Vigor</li>
<li>…using charm and social grace, + Wit</li>
<li>…with sharp senses and calm, + Clarity</li>
<li>…with quick thinking, + Knowledge</li>
<li>On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to bear.</li>
<li>On a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="recover">Recover</h3>
<p>When you do nothing but rest in comfort and safety after a day of rest you recover all your HP.</p>

</ul>

<li>On a 7–9, you survive the fate, but there is some permanent effect on you.</li>
<li>On 6-, your fate is sealed. You will die soon.</li>
</ul>
